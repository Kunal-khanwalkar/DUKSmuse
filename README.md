# DUKS muse

## Introduction

DUKS muse is a full-fledged music player built from scratch.

The music library is created using mySQL and is coupled with the front-end UI coded using Java Swings.

Every user has their own playlists, their unique user-history as well as recommendations derived from their song history.

## Code Details 


Netbeans is used to create the Project so it can directly be run when using Netbeans 8.
